# Email Providers

All providers implement the `MailProvider` interface, giving you a consistent API regardless of which email service you use:

```typescript
interface MailProvider {
  send(options: MailOptions): Promise<MailResponse>;
}
```

Choose the provider that best fits your infrastructure and swap between them without changing your application code.
