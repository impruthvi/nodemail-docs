# Introduction & Overview

**@impruthvi/nodemail** brings the simplicity and elegance of Laravel's Mail system to the Node.js ecosystem with full TypeScript support.

## Philosophy

- **Laravel-inspired** — If you've used `Mail::to()->send()` in Laravel, you'll feel right at home.
- **Lightweight** — Base package is ~25 MB (SMTP only). Install additional providers as needed.
- **Modular** — Providers, template engines, queue drivers, and markdown support are all optional peer dependencies.
- **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support with strict typing throughout.
